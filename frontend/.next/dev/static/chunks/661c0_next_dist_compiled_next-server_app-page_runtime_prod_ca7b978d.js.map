functions provided by this module are used to communicate certain properties\n * about the currently running code so that Next.js can make decisions on how to handle\n * the current execution in different rendering modes such as pre-rendering, resuming, and SSR.\n *\n * Today Next.js treats all code as potentially static. Certain APIs may only make sense when dynamically rendering.\n * Traditionally this meant deopting the entire render to dynamic however with PPR we can now deopt parts\n * of a React tree as dynamic while still keeping other parts static. There are really two different kinds of\n * Dynamic indications.\n *\n * The first is simply an intention to be dynamic. unstable_noStore is an example of this where\n * the currently executing code simply declares that the current scope is dynamic but if you use it\n * inside unstable_cache it can still be cached. This type of indication can be removed if we ever\n * make the default dynamic to begin with because the only way you would ever be static is inside\n * a cache scope which this indication does not affect.\n *\n * The second is an indication that a dynamic data source was read. This is a stronger form of dynamic\n * because it means that it is inappropriate to cache this at all. using a dynamic data source inside\n * unstable_cache should error. If you want to use some dynamic data inside unstable_cache you should\n * read that data outside the cache and pass it in as an argument to the cached function.\n */\n\nimport type { WorkStore } from '../app-render/work-async-storage.external'\nimport type {\n  WorkUnitStore,\n  RequestStore,\n  PrerenderStoreLegacy,\n  PrerenderStoreModern,\n  PrerenderStoreModernRuntime,\n} from '../app-render/work-unit-async-storage.external'\n\n// Once postpone is in stable we should switch to importing the postpone export directly\nimport React from 'react'\n\nimport { DynamicServerError } from '../../client/components/hooks-server-context'\nimport { StaticGenBailoutError } from '../../client/components/static-generation-bailout'\nimport {\n  getRuntimeStagePromise,\n  throwForMissingRequestStore,\n  workUnitAsyncStorage,\n} from './work-unit-async-storage.external'\nimport { workAsyncStorage } from '../app-render/work-async-storage.external'\nimport { makeHangingPromise } from '../dynamic-rendering-utils'\nimport {\n  METADATA_BOUNDARY_NAME,\n  VIEWPORT_BOUNDARY_NAME,\n  OUTLET_BOUNDARY_NAME,\n  ROOT_LAYOUT_BOUNDARY_NAME,\n} from '../../lib/framework/boundary-constants'\nimport { scheduleOnNextTick } from '../../lib/scheduler'\nimport { BailoutToCSRError } from '../../shared/lib/lazy-dynamic/bailout-to-csr'\nimport { InvariantError } from '../../shared/lib/invariant-error'\nimport { RenderStage } from './staged-rendering'\n\nconst hasPostpone = typeof React.unstable_postpone === 'function'\n\nexport type DynamicAccess = {\n  /**\n   * If debugging, this will contain the stack trace of where the dynamic access\n   * occurred.

To illustrate, if you were to use this data type to store\n * HTTP responses, the keypath would include the URL and everything listed by\n * the Vary header.\n * \n * See vary-path.ts for more details.\n *\n * The order of elements in a keypath must be consistent between lookups to\n * be considered the same, but besides that, the order of the keys is not\n * semantically meaningful.\n *\n * Keypaths may include a special kind of key called Fallback. When an entry is\n * stored with Fallback as part of its keypath, it means that the entry does not\n * vary by that key. When querying the cache, if an exact match is not found for\n * a keypath, the cache will check for a Fallback match instead. Each element of\n * the keypath may have a Fallback, so retrieval is an O(n ^ 2) operation, but\n * it's expected that keypaths are relatively short.\n *\n * Example:\n *   set(cacheMap, ['store', 'product', 1], PRODUCT_PAGE_1);\n *   set(cacheMap, ['store', 'product', Fallback], GENERIC_PRODUCT_PAGE);\n *\n *   // Exact match\n *   get(cacheMap, ['store', 'product', 1]) -> PRODUCT_PAGE_1\n *\n *   // Fallback match\n *   get(cacheMap, ['store', 'product', 2]) -> GENERIC_PRODUCT_PAGE\n *\n * Because we have the Fallback mechanism, we can impose a constraint that\n * regular JS maps do not have: a value cannot be stored at multiple keypaths\n * simultaneously. These cases should be expressed with Fallback keys instead.\n *\n * Additionally, because values only exist at a single keypath at a time, we\n * can optimize successive lookups by caching the internal map entry on the\n * value itself, using the `ref` field. This is especially useful because it\n * lets us skip the O(n ^ 2) lookup that occurs when Fallback entries\n * are present.\n *\n\n * How to decide if stuff belongs in here, or in cache.ts?\n * -------------------------------------------------------\n * \n * Anything to do with retrival, lifetimes, or eviction needs to go in this\n * module because it affects the fallback algorithm. For example, when\n * performing a lookup, if an entry is stale, it needs to be treated as\n * semantically equivalent to if the entry was not present at all.\n * \n * If there's logic that's not related to the fallback algorithm, though, we\n * should prefer to put it in cache.ts.\n */\n\ntype MapEntryShared<V extends MapValue> = {\n  parent: MapEntry<V> | null\n  key: any\n  map: Map<any, MapEntry<V>> | null\n\n  // LRU-related fields\n  prev: MapEntry<any> | null\n  next: MapEntry<any> | null\n  size: number\n}\n\ntype EmptyMapEntry<V extends MapValue> = MapEntryShared<V> & {\n  value: null\n}\n\ntype FullMapEntry<V extends MapValue> = MapEntryShared<V> & {\n  value: V\n}\n\nexport type MapEntry<V extends MapValue> = EmptyMapEntry<V> | FullMapEntry<V>\n\n// The CacheMap type is just the root entry of the map.\nexport type CacheMap<V extends MapValue> = MapEntry<V>\n\n// The protocol that values must implement.
